Originally delivered at University of Birmingham

Based upon (but not directly derived from) work by Matthew Collins, which was in turn based upon work by Nick Webber.

## About this course

This a re-design of the delivery of the module, begun in week 14 of the 20-week course in academic year 2019/2020.

The original 3 hours slot format of 1hr lecture/2hr lab session wasn't working too well for me or the students so I started this as a trial alternative approach.
